# Almost Amazon

This was an exercise for NSS where I built an admin app that allows a store owner to login to the app and manage books and authors.

## About the User

As a developer, it is important to understand the concepts / importance of Databases and how to access them, and Promises for allowing the page to load while the info from the database can be gathered. In this project, I learned about the following:
- XHR requests
- Promises
- Firebase
- ERDs
- Postman
- CRUD
- Promise.all()
- async/await
- .map()

## Features

After a successful login, the user is able to View the current available books, as well as any Authors assosiated with the Books. The user can edit both the Book and The Author Details, as well as adding a new Book or Author to the database. The user may also delete books individually, or by deleting an author, also removing all assosiated books. Using Merged Data, the Book cards display both the Book title as well as the Author name. The Author details show all books assosiated with the Author. Lastly, there is a search feature that searches for Books based on Book title, and Author names. This app acheives full CRUD.
